# scm_box
A simple two-box energy balance model of the global climate system coded in MATLAB.

# Structure
The framework can be understood by looking at the user scripts in the "usr" directory where the comments are mainly in Norwegian. These scripts can be run while solving the student exercise in the Oblig1.pdf document (also Norwegian). The comments for the framework itself (in the "src" directory) and the input files are all in English. If you happen to be interested in using this repository but can't understand some aspect of the code (or Norwegian) then feel free to post an issue and I can try and make the required changes.

# Background
I developed this pedagogical simple climate modeling framework during the summer of 2014 working as a developer in the Computing in Science Education (CSE) initiative at the Section for Meteorology and Oceanography, Department of Geosciences, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, University of Oslo (UiO), Oslo, Norway, Planet Earth. The purpose was to use this framework as the main tool in one (out of two) obligatory exercises given to bachelor students in the course GEF1100: The Climate System at the Department of Geosciecnes (UiO). It was used for this purpose in the Fall 2014 and Fall 2015 semesters. After this it was ported to python by another teaching assistant and used also in Fall 2016 and Fall 2017. Since this framework is no longer being used given that the GEF1100 course has been discontinued, I decided to upload it as a repository mainly to archive it for myself but also in case it is useful for students or instructors in the climate sciences.
